# Java-Microservices-CQRS-Event-Sourcing

This Java backend application is a microservices model having the Apache Kafka middleware as communication bus.

The implementation of the microservices were created using Spring Boot, connected to databases such as MySql and MongoDb, based on CQRS and Event Sourcing development patterns.

5. Design and implementation of CQRS and Event Sourcing.
6. Use Apache Kafka as a Message Bus.
7. Optimistic Concurrency Control.
